# Parental Involvement in Children's Lives - Data Visualization Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the documentation and code for a data visualization project conducted by a group of students from San Jose State University. The project aims to highlight the importance of parents being involved in their children's lives and explores the correlation between various family-related factors and juvenile delinquency.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to emphasize the crucial role parents play in shaping their children's behavior and well-being. Research suggests that strong parental involvement can lead to better outcomes for adolescents, while the absence of parents or poor family relationships may contribute to delinquent behavior. The team conducted an analysis to visualize these correlations and provide insights into the significance of parental involvement.

## Project Methodology

To achieve the project's goals, the team followed a structured methodology:

1. **Data Selection**: The team selected relevant data from available sources to analyze the relationship between family-related factors and juvenile delinquency.

2. **Data Analysis**: Using Jupyter notebooks, the team performed data analysis and calculated correlations between various family features and delinquent behaviors.

3. **Data Visualization**: The project used data visualization techniques to present the findings effectively. Various types of visualizations were created to illustrate the correlations.

## Tools and Technologies Used

The following tools and technologies were employed in this project:

- **Python**: Python programming language was used for data analysis, visualization, and code development.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter notebooks were utilized for data analysis and visualization tasks.

- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib library was used for creating static visualizations.

- **Seaborn**: Seaborn was employed for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics.

- **Pandas**: Pandas library was used for data manipulation and analysis.
- ** Tableau**: Tableau was used for visualization purpose

## Data Visualizations

### 1. Frequency of Family Time vs. Delinquent Acts

This visualization compares the frequency of time spent with family to the occurrence of delinquent acts such as possession of a weapon and shoplifting.

### 2. Parental Awareness vs. Delinquent Behavior

This visualization explores the extent of parents' awareness about their children's companions when they go out, in relation to delinquent behaviors like hard liquor consumption, shoplifting, and vandalism.

### 3. Parental Separation and Juvenile Delinquency

This visualization investigates the impact of parents' separation or divorce on juvenile delinquent activities, including carrying weapons, shoplifting, vandalism, and hard liquor consumption.

### 4. Parental Substance Abuse and Delinquent Acts

These visualizations demonstrate the relationship between parental substance abuse and delinquent behaviors, including shoplifting, intentional damage, and bicycle/scooter theft.

### 5. Strongest Positive Correlated Family Features to Delinquent Behavior

This visualization provides a summary of the family features that have the strongest positive correlation with delinquent behaviors.

## Conclusion

The project's visualizations reveal significant correlations between family-related factors and juvenile delinquency. Some key findings include the negative correlation between spending time with family and delinquent acts and the positive correlation between parental substance abuse and delinquent behaviors. These findings underscore the importance of parental involvement in children's lives for their well-being and behavior.
